A) Outline
The objective of this document is to present comprehensive, country-specific security
requirements for the smart camera. A smart camera is a consumer Internet of Things (IoT)
device that remotely captures multimedia (such as audio, video, image, etc.) and can perform
intelligent analysis functions (such as movement detection) and share the information with
the consumer (over mobile/web-based interface). The smart camera can be a part of a video
surveillance system (VSS) that provides display and storage of the video captured by multiple

Chapter 1 – Overview
Introduction:
A smart camera is a popular alternative to the traditional digital camera that can extract
specific information from the captured images or videos (Ref: ER TEC28822108). Smart
cameras are widely used in a multitude of applications, including fingerprint readers, smart
camera phones, human-computer interfaces, machine visions, and video surveillance. The
smart cameras installed for surveillance in a home can be wired or wireless cameras. A user
can access these cameras using a custom-built app on a mobile phone via two modes:
connecting to the gateway via Wi-Fi or by connecting over the Internet and getting routed to
the camera. The smart camera can process images and, in some cases, take action. For
example, a camera deployed for home surveillance can trigger an alarm or send an email to
a user when an entity is detected. Unlike traditional CCTV cameras that record continuously,
smart cameras may record instances of activities when detecting any motion by in-built
sensors.
Smart Camera Architecture:
The hardware architecture of a smart camera varies based on the application domain and
constraints on size, cost, and power consumption. The basic architecture of a smart camera
is shown in Figure 1. A smart camera captures images using image sensors and stores them
in the memory module. Also, the communication interface handles the transportation of
images to another device or part(s) of the video surveillance system (VSS). The processor of
a smart camera controls the device’s functionality and analyses the captured image to gather
information.
Figure 1. Smart Camera Architecture (adopted from [6])
VSS Architecture:
ITSAR No: ITSAR309062504 Page 14 of 76
A VSS consists of a camera module, a gateway, and mobile devices. A camera collects video,
audio, alarm signals, and other information, which can be conveyed to the gateway and
transmitted, delivered, stored, or processed by the gateway. Gateway is the central controller
responsible for configurations, access, authorization, maintenance, and update. It provides
services to the user, such as watching videos, receiving alarms, and controlling camera
functionality. Users and the camera can access the gateway with a fixed or mobile network. A
typical architecture of VSS used indoors is shown in Figure 2. BIS IS 16910 (Part 1/Sec 1)
identifies that a VSS for security applications has three functional blocks which portray the
various parts and functions of the system. The three major functional parts are Video
Environment, System Management, and System Security. System security includes system
integrity and data integrity that protects the VSS from intentional and unintentional
interference during normal operation. System integrity defines the physical security of all
system components and control of physical and logical access to the VSS. Data integrity
covers logical access to the data and prevention of loss or manipulation of the data.

Smart Camera Security:
To provide sufficient security to the Smart Camera and the data, a coordinated effort from all
stakeholders is essential. The scope of this document is limited to mandatory requirements
and recommendations for the design and implementation of devices from Environmental
ITSAR No: ITSAR309062504 Page 15 of 76
Class-I (residential/office environment) with all security grades and access levels. The smart
camera pertaining to Class-I (BIS IS 16910 (Part 1/Sec 1)) provides monitoring functions and
solutions for homes/offices with detection needs. Also, it supports several surveillance
assistant functions such as remote viewing on multiple devices, two-way real-time audio,
storage methods, and human detection to help users. Security for physical and hardware,
firmware and operating system, Communication, operation and maintenance, application
domain, and data protection are some of the baseline security requirements.
Keeping in view of the device functionality and capabilities and referring to various
standards on IoT security, specifically ETSI EN 303 645 V2.1.1 (2020-06), ENISA Baseline
security recommendations for IoT November 2017, IoT SF IoT Security Assurance
Framework Release 3.0 Nov 2021 Security Assurance Framework, GSMA CLP suitable
common security requirements for the smart camera are developed in this document. Also,
specific security requirements are developed considering the industry specifications for the
consumer smart camera.
Classification of IoT devices based on Security Features
Making the whole diversity of IoT-class applications adhere to a common security objective
is a subjective endeavour. Even within vertical sectors such as consumer and enterprise, the
security measures and strength of controls will vary depending on the actual use case.
Though international standards exist for IoT security viz., ETSI 303 645, IoT SF security
framework for IoT, there is no harmonization of these standards. In an endeavour to classify
IoT devices based on Security features, TEC (Telecom Engineering Centre) has mapped the
device classifications from various standard bodies in its technical report- “Security by
Design for IoT Device Manufacturers”.
In the above report, TEC has also proposed “Classification for IoT devices in India”. This
classification has IoT devices varying from Level-0 to Level-4 covering the CIA
(Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability) triad requirements along with authentication
and authorization covering baseline security requirements and principles of security by
design.
The proposed classification has Level-0 meeting no security requirements, Level-1 meeting
the baseline requirements, Level-2 adhering to international cybersecurity standards for IoT,
Level-3 meeting the principles of security by design and having no known software
vulnerabilities and Level-4 device being resistant to cyber security attacks by undergoing
penetration testing.
ITSAR No: ITSAR309062504 Page 16 of 76
To develop Indian Telecom Security Assurance Requirements (ITSARs) for the gamut of
Consumer IoT devices, National Centre for Communication Security (NCCS) adopts the
cybersecurity device classification proposed in the “Security by Design for IoT Device
Manufacturers” report of TEC.
The TEC report also explains the five levels of IoT devices as below.
Level 0: Such devices are very constrained devices with very low processing power, no data
encryption and message encryption. Such type of devices may not enable a secure
communication and should be allowed to work through such gateways which can add the
required measure of security. Without the security augmentation by a Gateway, such type of
devices should not be permitted for use in mission critical infrastructure. It is required that
the Gateways used to connect such devices will follow the security assurance at Level 2 /
Level 3.
Level-1: Devices of this level must use a protocol stack specifically designed for IoT devices
with constraints, such as Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). Device examples in this
category can include environmental sensors. Devices in this category should meet the
baseline requirements of ETSI EN 303 645 i.e. no default password, ensuring the availability
of security updates and implementing means to manage vulnerability reporting.
Level-2: Security requirement of Level-1 and adherence to international standards (secure
identity, software asset security etc.).
Level-3: Absence of Known Common Software Vulnerabilities. The devices must meet the
Security assurance requirements of Level-2 and also the software used in the connected
device must be evaluated by a test laboratory using automated binary analysers to ensure
that there is no known critical software weakness, vulnerabilities or malware.
Level-4: The device should perform well against the penetration tests by approved third
party test labs, and fulfil Level-3 requirements. The IoT device undergoes penetration testing
by a test laboratory to provide a basic level of resistance against common cybersecurity
attacks.
ITSAR No: ITSAR309062504 Page 17 of 76
Proposed levels for IoT devices [Ref: Table 7 Proposed levels for IoT devices from
“Security by Design for IoT Device Manufacturers” published by TEC]
Level ‘0’ type of devices may not enable secure communication and they do not meet baseline
security requirements. They can be allowed to work through only gateways which can add
the required measure of security. For ITSAR purpose, the level ‘0’ classification is not
considered as these devices do not meet baseline security requirements and hence, it is not
possible to carry out security certification at Level ‘0’.
Classification of Security Requirements:
ITSAR No: ITSAR309062504 Page 18 of 76
In order to apply an appropriate level of security assurance to an IoT device, This ITSAR has
four levels of security requirements classified based on the classification of IoT devices
proposed in “Security by Design for IoT Device Manufacturers” report of TEC.
The security requirements to be met by the IoT device under each level are explained below.
Level 1: Baseline Security Requirements
The level 1 device shall meet the requirement of no default password, ensuring the
availability of security updates and implementing means to manage vulnerability reporting.
It also shall meet the basic security requirements such as message encryption, data
encryption, device ID management (Physical/Logical), logging availability, secure firmware
update and patch update, vulnerability management and response, user authentication,
password management and access control mechanisms.
Level 2: Adherence to Cybersecurity based on International Standards
In addition to fulfilling Level 1 requirements, the level 2 device shall have integrated features
to provide adherence to cybersecurity such as attack protection, tamper resistance, security
assessment certificates, data integrity, platform integrity, software assets protection and
response, data authentication and device ID verification.
Level 3: Adherence to the Principles of Security-by-Design, and Absence of Known
Common Software Vulnerabilities
In addition to fulfilling Level 2 requirements, the level 3 device shall have adherence to the
principles of Security-by Design and absence of known common software vulnerabilities by
using features like secure booting and integrity test / self-test, external attack prevention
and response, secure monitoring and secure policy update and response.
Level 4: Resistance against Common Cyber-Attacks and undergo for penetration
testing
In addition to fulfilling Level 3 requirements, the level 4 device shall have resistance against
common cyber-attacks, it undergoes penetration testing and incorporates the usage of
biometric authentication.
Minimum level of Security Certification
For the Smart Camera, the minimum-security certification required shall be at least Level
3 and above. In other words, for smart cameras to get Security Certified as per this ITSAR,
the minimum-security requirements to be met are Level 3 and above.
